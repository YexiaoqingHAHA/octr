the trump steel tariffs are economically small and symbolically huge markets like to look into the future and with this latest trade policy they don t like what they see steel blast furnace 8 at the corporation thyssenkrupp in duisburg germany friedemann vogel european pressphoto agency to understand why the worry about president trumpâ€™s planned steel and aluminum tariffs goes so deep on wall street and in corporate america donâ€™t think of thursdayâ€™s news as being about a new tariff on steel and aluminum rather think of it as a signal about the willingness of the president to ignore his most sober minded advisers and put the global economy at risk to achieve his goal of better terms for american trade much of the rhetoric from business and conservative groups has focused narrowly on the potential cost of the tariffs make no mistake this is a tax on american families the national retail federation said it is a huge job killing tax hike on american consumers said senator mike lee a utah republican in terms of direction this assessment is doubtless correct the new tariffs will tend over time to make automobiles and beer cans and lots of other items more expensive but in terms of magnitude it is misleading as commerce secretary wilbur ross argued in a cnbc interview on friday for most consumer items weâ€™re discussing trivial amounts of tax â€” an extra fraction of a penny for the can that contains campbellâ€™s soup a few tenths of a percent on the price of a new car steel imports were worth about $30 billion in 2017 and aluminum imports around $17 billion according to government data even in the simplest possible way of thinking of the potential cost of the new tariffs â€” just applying the 25 percent tax on steel and 10 percent tax on aluminum the president plans â€” weâ€™re talking about only $9 billion and thatâ€™s before accounting for the resulting shift toward domestic production that is the entire point of the policy more complex modeling would be needed to produce a reliable estimate of the cost of the tariffs but the point is about the order of magnitude these are not numbers that are enough to cause much damage to a $20 trillion economy or to justify the $460 billion decline in the value of the stock market that took place between thursdayâ€™s open and friday midday this market drop makes more sense if you look at the presidentâ€™s announcement not in terms of what it means for imported steel and aluminum but rather what it says about the president himself the most consistent economic idea running through president trumpâ€™s decades in public life has been a conviction that the united states is being duped in the global trade arena he has denounced china called for ripping apart the north american free trade agreement and accused generations of american trade negotiators of being incompetent yet in the first 13 months of the trump administration even as the president kept using bombastic language about trade any formal action was restrained an incident from april is instructive after leaks indicating that mr trump planned to withdraw the united states from nafta there was an onslaught of phone calls to the white house from c e o â€™s and international leaders and pro trade advisers worked to get the presidentâ€™s ear he backed off saying the next day that he would give nafta renegotiation a try when the administration has acted on trade â€” with tariffs on solar panels and washing machines most notably â€” it has been relatively narrow move that fit comfortably with precedent and was unlikely to spark global blowback lately there has even been talk that the administration might reverse course and move to rejoin the trans pacific partnership the trade deal that the united states pulled out of at the start of the trump administration more broadly financial markets spent the first year of the trump presidency gaining comfort that investors could count on the administration to deliver business friendly economic policy regardless of presidential bombast that came through in such areas as the tax law which cut the corporate income tax rate substantially and appointments to key economic posts like the former private equity executive jerome powell as chairman of the federal reserve then came thursday mr trump not only overruled his more pro trade advisers but he also did so in an impromptu way seemingly setting policy before the details had been worked out and without buy in from across his own administration and by invoking national security concerns as the rationale for the action the president was setting a precedent that could give other countries more wiggle room to use security as a reason for imposing tariffs on american goods moreover on friday rather than try to tamp down fears of an all out trade war president trump appeared to relish the idea in a twitter message he said that for a large country like the united states trade wars are good and easy to win financial markets tend to extrapolate looking at small pieces of information today to project what the future will look like thatâ€™s why when a company reports disappointing financial results for a single quarter â€” missing an earnings target by a few million dollars for example â€” markets sometime lop billions from the companyâ€™s value the united states economy in the aftermath of the tariff announcement is the equivalent the steel and aluminum tariffs are manageable but if the president is so gung ho about a trade war and is now willing to ignore his more cautious advisers what

blast furnaces at u s steelâ€™s granite city works in granite city ill credit luke sharrett for the new york times washington â€” after a year of delighting conservatives with tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks president trump is finally following through on the type of trade crackdowns that terrify republican leaders in congress and many economists they warn that the trade war mr trump appears eager to launch could backfire sending america and the world into recession mr trump said on thursday that he would soon levy tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from every foreign country a move that sent stocks tumbling through the end of the day on friday he ramped up his rhetoric in the face of criticism saying on twitter that trade wars are good and easy to win many economists say the opposite that even the prospect of a trade war will hurt the economic expansion that is underway and that mr trump loves to take credit for industries that buy steel and aluminum not to mention agricultural exporters employ many times more people than the industries that the president wants to protect said peter a petri an economist and trade expert at brandeis universityâ€™s international business school whether we go through with his approach is anyoneâ€™s guess but business investment depends on predictable policy and relentless chaos takes its toll even if cooler heads prevail on the policies that the president is tweeting about the planned tariffs are stiff 25 percent for steel and 10 percent for aluminum they appear likely to buoy domestic investment and to some degree job creation in those industries while raising prices on consumers and squeezing other industries that rely heavily on metals such as automobile manufacturing and beverage production they were hailed by

advertisement continue reading the main story on their own the tariffs appear unlikely to affect growth or inflation to a great degree economists said mr trumpâ€™s tariffs would by themselves have only a small macroeconomic impact said mark zandi the chief economist at moodyâ€™s analytics and a vocal critic of mr trumpâ€™s trade agenda during the campaign mr zandi said they were likely to add not quite 0 1 percentage points to inflation which is currently hovering just under 2 percent and to reduce economic growth by only a few hundredths of a percentage point what worries many economists particularly on wall street is the prospect that mr trump is set to launch a broader trade war the national security grounds he is invoking as rationale for the tariffs could provoke swift retaliation from trading partners such as canada which will be affected far more by the measures than china will this is likely to escalate trade tensions economists at goldman sachs wrote on thursday particularly as it looks likely to apply to a broad group of countries including to some allies of the u s we expect further disruptive trade developments over the coming months the tariffs could also bring condemnation from the world trade organization â€” and a potentially dramatic showdown if the united states ignores rulings from the group which has been marginalized by the trump administration if such problems spiral worldwide mr zandi said a particularly dark scenario could end in a global trade war the economic fallout from such a war could be serious ending in a global recession

is now at the center on budget and policy priorities you always hear trade war at these moments that doesnâ€™t mean thatâ€™s always wrong but it usually is from the beginning of his insurgent 2016 presidential campaign mr trump has seen winning on trade â€” measured by reducing bilateral trade deficits particularly with china the trading partner mr trump is most concerned with â€” as critical for boosting the economy reducing trade deficits he has argued will work in tandem with lowering taxes and reducing federal regulations to supercharge growth mr trump took several steps last year to freeze or roll back regulations and he signed a $1 5 trillion tax cut bill in december he also took initial steps to reorient trade policy pulling out of the trans pacific partnership and embarking on a fractious renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement but while economic growth accelerated the trade deficit in goods and services widened to $566 billion for the year the largest amount since 2008 the goods deficit with china hit $375 billion a record the tariffs mr trump announced thursday were his boldest move yet on trade and a sign of resurgent power in the white house for economic adviser peter navarro and commerce secretary wilbur l ross jr who have long pushed mr trump to act more aggressively on trade which was a signature campaign issue they were a reminder to the republican establishment that mr trumpâ€™s theory of the economy is sometimes at odds with traditional free market conservatism for as much as they overlap on thursday the conservative wall street journal editorial board called the tariffs the biggest policy blunder of his presidency the move is also at odds with a broad and bipartisan swath of previous top white house economists going back several administrations who urged mr trump in a letter last year to avoid a policy that would likely incur greater economic and diplomatic costs than any conceivable national security gain jerome h powell the new federal reserve chairman appointed by mr trump told congress on thursday that the tariff approach is not the best approach for trade disputes 56 comments mr trump though casts himself as protecting an industry he sees as endangered; raw steel production in america remains higher than it was 25 years ago but it is down dramatically from the 1970s as he tweeted on friday such rhetoric will likely boost mr trump in industrial states such as ohio and pennsylvania which were both key to his 2016 victory but in the event of a trade war they could rebound to hurt many of his other base voters last year researchers at the brookings metropolitan policy program reported that small rural communities would be disproportionately hurt by a trade shock they compiled a list of the 10 metro areas most vulnerable to such a shock because of their economic reliance on exports those areas were in indiana texas louisiana south carolina and alabama â€” all states mr trump carried
