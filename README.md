Online Bayesian Collaborative Topic Regression

This is just a Python version of [Online Bayesian Collaborative Topic Regression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.08872.pdf).

The original implementation by the authors is found [here](https://github.com/tao-j/online-x/).

I was inspired to look at this after reading https://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/building-the-next-new-york-times-recommendation-engine/ and a paper it referenced, [Collaborative Topic Modeling for Recommending Scientific Articles](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/papers/WangBlei2011.pdf). A straightforward implementation of CTM can be found [here](https://github.com/arongdari/python-topic-model/blob/master/ptm/collabotm.py).
